# Interim consensus process

1. Before each weekly meeting any member who has previously ranked 5 or 6 for at least 3 weeks may introduce a proposal for consideration by the community. This proposal shall be posted as a link in the comment section of the hive post where we record the consensus results that week. Each qualifying member may only propose one item per week.
2. After each weekly meeting (on the same video call), those who rank 6 may discuss the proposal, and if they approve they can reply to the comment with "Approve" or "Reject". If 2/3 of those who rank 6 that week approve then the proposal passes.
3. If 2/3 of the Rank 6 fail to reach a consensus within 1 hour to either Approve or Reject then the Rank 6 individuals lose the respect they earned that week.
