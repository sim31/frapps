# Optimism Fractal Intent

**Optimism Fractal is a community dedicated to fostering collaboration, awarding public good creators, and optimizing governance on the Superchain.**

### **1. Respect Game meetings**

1. [Respect Game](https://github.com/sim31/frapps/blob/6d3d25a6b9720004e6e3425a846286ef35664d76/concepts/apps/of2/OF2-CONCEPT.md#2-respect-game) meetings happen biweekly;
2. At the start of the meeting participants are randomly distributed into break-out groups of 3 to 6 people. Each break-out group plays [Respect game](https://github.com/sim31/frapps/blob/6d3d25a6b9720004e6e3425a846286ef35664d76/concepts/apps/of2/OF2-CONCEPT.md#2-respect-game), which lasts for 45 minutes;

### **2. Respect Game**

1. Each participant of the group is given up to 4 minutes to present their contributions. Their presentation should answer the following question: "What did I do to grow Optimism over the past two weeks?"
2. After everyone has had time to present, the group tries to reach consensus on rankings of contributions;
3. The participant who has contributed the most gets Level 6, the second biggest contributor gets level 5 and so on;

### 3. Respect

1. Respect is a non-transferable token representing respect (an opinion) that a community (in this case Optimism Fractal) has on a particular account;
2. Respect is not a property that can by owned by anyone (or anything) and no participating party owns Respect;

### 4. Respect Distribution

1. Respect should be distributed to participants of each break-out group which was able to reach consensus:
    1. Level 6 receives 55 Respect;
    2. Level 5 receives 34 Respect;
    3. Level 4 receives 21 Respect;
    4. Level 3 receives 13 Respect;
    5. Level 2 receives 8 Respect;
    6. Level 1 receives 5 Respect;
    

### 5. Consensus process

1. Every two weeks, during Respect Game meeting, a poll is created for participants to register to take part in the consensus process of Optimism Fractal over the next two weeks. This is "registration poll". Participants can register throughout the entire two weeks;
2. Top 6 Parent Respect earners out of those who registered in the previous registration constitute a "council" for the current period;
3. A new council is activated at the start of a Respect Game meeting. Respect distribution at that moment is used to determine the council;
4. If fewer than 6 participants have registered, then council is smaller (consists only of those who registered);
5. A proposal is said to be passed by Optimism Fractal if at least 2/3rds of council members signal approval for it;
6. Proposals passed by the council can:
    1. Signal opinion of Optimism Fractal community;
    2. Make changes to the rules of Optimism Fractal (i.e.: rules expressed here);
    3. Select software implementation of Optimism Fractal (i.e.: implementation of rules defined here - smart contract deployment, official frontends, etc);
    4. Blacklist break-out group results;
    5. Make changes to the current Respect distribution (burn existing or mint additional Respect);
7. Optimism Fractal does not have any control or any other kind of power over any participating parties;

### 6. Parent Respect token

1. Respect token deployed as the following contract on Optmimism Mainnet is "Parent Respect" of Optimism Fractal: [0x53C9E3a44B08E7ECF3E8882996A500eb06c0C5CC](https://www.notion.so/4b08e7ecf3e8882996a500eb06c0c5cc?pvs=21);

### 7. Executive contract

1. [Executive contract](https://snapshot.org/#/optimismfractal.eth/proposal/0x3c35f474b1e2c037f32455abd75d027aa29d402200ac649fecb8b46c789c26a3) is an onchain smart contract selected by consensus process to execute onchain actions necessary to distribute Respect and implement the will expressed by the consensus process.
2. Executive contract can be changed by the consensus process at any time;
