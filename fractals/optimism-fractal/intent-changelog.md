# Historical Notes on Intent document

There have been a few changes to the core intents and specifications above since Optimism Fractal started in October, 2023. An overview of these changes to our intents are provided below.

1. The initial version was created by the [Optimystics](https://optimystics.io/) team before the first Optimism Fractal event.

2. The Optimystics team made the first change in January 2024 via the legacy consensus process before the end of Optimism Fractal’s [bootstrap phase](https://optimismfractal.com/details/original-intent/optimism-fractal-original-intent-document#block-167bd4bb1f4f42dd86ddc1fe28360deb). The main change at this time was the addition of the community consensus process defined above. You can learn more about this by exploring the article about our [council](https://optimismfractal.com/council) and watching the videos linked in the article. 

3. This Optimism Fractal Council approved a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/optimismfractal.eth/proposal/0xbe0d658597adfea76ddf7d082682ac238c521fb39836ced176c8ad7a604f6d84) to update Optimism Fractal’s core intents in June, 2024. This proposal added optimizing governance to the intents and clarified Optimism as the Superchain. The proposal was approved by the community via the consensus process defined above. You can watch a related video and learn more about this change [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/announcing-optimism-fractal-s-intent-to-optimize-governance-on-the-superchain/8399). 

4. The Optimism Fractal Council approved a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/optimismfractal.eth/proposal/0x3c35f474b1e2c037f32455abd75d027aa29d402200ac649fecb8b46c789c26a3) to move to ORDAO smart contracts and change our intents in November, 2024. This provided the community (composed of 65 people who participated in our first four seasons) with a consensus process to execute onchain actions necessary to distribute Respect and implement the will expressed by the consensus process.

5. The Optimism Fractal Council approved a [proposal](https://snapshot.box/#/s:optimismfractal.eth/proposal/0x44d911c3376512bb7dc0377aef7e9230d537a3d117c59e19d11623230d624d3e) to transition to biweekly events and a [second proposal](https://snapshot.box/#/s:optimismfractal.eth/proposal/0x80a6cce942bef1893229256b2b148fa0491d146d7bb2f0021fa9376a9e91aa6a) update core intents in December 2024. The changes to core intents modified our event cadence, refined our core intent statement, and enhanced our contribution prompt to emphasize ecosystem growth.
