# ZAO Fractal

Our mission is to empower independent creators by demystifying technology and providing the tools, knowledge, and support they need to take control of their work, data, and fan connections.

In a world where traditional labels take large percentages of revenue, the ZAO offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that puts profits and power back into the hands of creators.

We believe in breaking down technological and financial jargon so anyone with an internet connection can join the creator economy.

The ZAO (ZTalent Artist Organization) is a community-driven hub where musicians, artists, and technologists unite to unlock the potential of Web 3 and emerging technologies.

## Our Ecosystem: The ZTalent Network
The ZAO is part of a broader ecosystem, a diverse network that includes projects like:

* **WaveWarZ**: An onchain music competition where artists battle by showcasing their best songs to win a prize for themselves and a fan. 'Super votes' offer enhanced voting power alongside the judges and give fans a chance to win a prize if their chosen artist wins. Sponsors can participate by winning the 1/1 sponsorship auction, which also serves as the prize fund for the next WaveWarZ event.
* **‍ZAO FESTIVALS**: A series of in-person concerts designed to showcase the power of blockchain for artists.
‍* **ZAO-PALOOZA**: Held during NFT NYC, ZAO-PALOOZA featured 12 artists, 6 of whom were new to Web 3, offering a groundbreaking introduction to decentralized technology in music.
‍* **ZAO-CHELLA**: A future event scheduled for Art Basel 2024. Stay tuned for more details!
