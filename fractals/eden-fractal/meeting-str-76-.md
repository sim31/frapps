# Meeting structure (meetings 77-)

Eden Fractal meetings will last for 1 hour from 16-17 UTC. A proposal can be created on Consortium to choose an agenda, such as experimenting with the Respect Game to decide topics or choosing a mission. This will follow the standard rules of [Cagendas](../../concepts/cagendas.md) to determine the agenda for each meeting.
