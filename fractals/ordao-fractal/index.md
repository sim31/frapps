## Relationship with ORDAO Office Hours
After first working versions of [ORDAO](https://github.com/sim31/ordao) were released, a series of meetings were held where ORDAO was introduced, explained and taught how to use. These meetings were called "ORDAO office Hours". During them participants experimented with ORDAO by submitting Respect Game results to ORDAO deployment created for this purpose. These 8 meetings produced a Respect distribution representing people most knowledgeble about ORDAO at the tie. ORDAO Fractal ended up using this Respect distribution as [parent Respect](./concept.md) (token that determines vote weights in [orec](../../concepts/orec.md)).
