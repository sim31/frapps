# ORConsole (ORDAO console)

[ORConsole](../apps/console) is a documentation / console app for interacting with ORDAO. It's already working and it's the main tool right now which I use to interact with ORDAO. It exposes all the functionality that will take time to develop in the GUI frontend. You can think of ORConsole as a web-app for the fractal where all the functionalities are available early in a command-line fashion.

Most importantly it provides documentation for the programming API to interact with Ordao which will make it easier for anyone to build a GUI for ORDAO (or at least some of its features).

See [DOCS-INDEX.md](./DOCS-INDEX.md) for details on how to use.
