# Tripartite governance model
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence -->
<!-- TODO: judicial branch can't evaluate other processes - it evaluates sub-entities (individuals) within the organization.-->

* Legislative - process to determine course of action;
* Executive - process to execute course of action;
* Judicial - process to evaluate and regulate all other processes;

## Defining qualities of a legislative process
How to recognize a legislative process within your organization (you should find at least some of the qualities):

* It is a first step in decision-making pipeline;
* It deals in concepts highest-level of abstraction;
* It talks in end-user language;
* It involves discussion and delibaration;
* It is slow;
* It is used more rarely then executive process;
* It is only used in edge-case or unexpected scenarios and when changing something about the current operation;
* It is independent from executive process;
* It is relied upon whenever something in executive process breaks down;

## Defining qualities of an executive process
How to recognize an executive process within your organization (you should find at least some of the qualities):

* It is a final step in decision-making process;
* It executes what legislative process decides, taking care of the details;
* It talks in lower-level, more technical language than legislative process;
* It is an entity within some larger, external system / platform. E.g.:
  * a smart contract account within a blockchain;
  * a legal entity within the legal structure of some country;
* It represents your organization within a larger system / platform;
* It deals in concepts of the larger system within which it exists;
* It is fast;
* It is used frequently;
* It performs routine tasks for the organization;
* Part of it is code (i.e.: it is partly automated);
* It is independent from legislative process;
* It can keep the organization running even when legislative process breaks down;

## Defining qualities of judicial process
How to recognize an judicial process within your organization:

* It evaluates / judges;
* It can evaluate contributions to legislative and executive processes;
* It can make adjustments to (regulate) legislative and executive processes;

## Relationship to Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow" model
Daniel Kahneman, in his book ["Thinking Fast, Slow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) presents a thesis that there are two modes of thought: "System 1" is fast, instinctive and emotional; "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Since then it has been shown that this model is useful even in the field of AI and robotics ([source 1](https://medium.com/@ignacio.de.gregorio.noblejas/the-robotics-breakthrough-that-obsoleted-openai-075015d9fe91), [source 2](https://medium.com/@ignacio.de.gregorio.noblejas/energy-based-ais-too-good-to-be-true-54fe9cb47c72), [source 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05206)).

"Thinking fast, slow" might be an alternative conceptualization of the same truth about intelligence and decision-making as [legislative branch resembles system 2, while executive branch resembles system 1](https://www.notion.so/Review-comments-and-improve-v1-of-Governance-Integration-Strategy-Democratic-Fund-Distribution-Thro-1af074f5adac803bafdddaf8438ed68b?d=1b3074f5adac803bb17e001c8e2be6ec&source=copy_link#1af074f5adac804baa78dd0624e3b72d).

## Example
<!-- TODO: link to docs here -->
[Optimism Fractal](../fractals/optimism-fractal/):
* [Consensus process]() (legislative process) - uses existing respect distribution to create councils which pass proposals within [snapshot](snapshot.box);
* [Executive process]()  takes care of implementing those proposals onchain and performing other routine tasks like Respect distribution;
* [Respect game](./respect-game.md) (judicial process) - evaluates everyone's contributions on weekly basis minting more Respect for individuals contributing more value, thus regulating amount of power each individual has in legislative as well as in executive processes;
