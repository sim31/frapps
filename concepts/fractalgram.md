# Fractalgram

Fractalgram is an app that implements the following method to fascilitate building consensus in break-out room session of [respect game](./respect-game.md):

1. A poll is created with a question "Who should be ranked as level 6?" and all participants of the break-out room as the options;
2. Participants vote and discuss until they reach consensus;
3. The process repeats for the remaining levels 5 through 1 until all the participants are ranked. Polls do not include participants that are already ranked by consensus in previous polls.
