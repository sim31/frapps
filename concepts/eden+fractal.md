# Eden+Fractal

1. Make break-out room sessions longer by 15 minutes
2. Each break-out room after determining rankings for weekly contributions tries to reach consensus on a delegate to elect (it can be different from the top contributor);
3. Delegates from each break-out room together constitute a council for that week;
4. Each council serves for 4 weeks (this means that at any point in time fractal has 4 councils);
5. Councils from different weeks may have the same people in them;
6. Council is said to "approve a proposal" when at least 2/3rds of its members vote to approve it, during the hour after the break-out room session;
7. Proposal is passed once at least 3 out of 4 active councils approve it, during the hour after break-out room session;
