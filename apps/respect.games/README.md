# Respect.games

A full-featured application enabling asynchronous gameplay, on-chain contribution tracking, and flexible reward distribution. The [Respect.Games](http://Respect.Games) platform provides an all-in-one solution for launching and managing Respect Games, complete with user profiles, automated Respect distribution, and integrated onchain proposal voting. 

This implementation focuses on making the Respect Game accessible to a broader range of communities with different needs. Enhanced by Graph Protocol integration for efficient data querying of onchain data, it offers a comprehensive interface for asynchronous community coordination. Developed over 2-3 months of full-time work and completed in September 2024, the app is now currently in testing phase with multiple communities.
